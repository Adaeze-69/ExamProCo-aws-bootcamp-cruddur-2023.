# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
# JOURNALING

# Create a User in my AWS Root Account
I created a user and assigned Billing and Admin policy to it from my root account. My user account Adaeze_Ontario_BootCamp1 is what I will be using for the bootcamp to do my hands-on projects.


# Create a budget
I was able to create a budget of $10 in my AWS console just so I know my spend limit when I reach the $10 and I do not over board with my spendng. Attached is an image of it.

I also run the budget using CLI in my Gitpod account and you can confirm the coomands under my budget.json. Below is the command I run.
```
aws budgets create-budget --account-id MY ID --budget file://pera1.json --notifications-with-subscribers file://pera2.json

```

# Install AWS CLI in my Gitpod Account
My Gitpod is linked to my GitHub account and so, the commands I run in the Gitpod, I made sure to commit them to my GitHub account.
I installed my AWS CLI via my gitpod with the following command

```
url "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

```

Output of Command

    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::154334184944:user/Adaeze_Ontario_BootCamp1"
